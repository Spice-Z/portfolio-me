## Story

Many Japanese people feel that they aren’t good at English because **they rarely have opportunities to use English in daily life**.

<br>

Japan has a lot of English learning content, but most of it features audio recordings by professionals, **making it hard to study with authentic English audio**.

<br>

So, I decided to create an **app that supports English learning using real English audio**.

Since I enjoy listening to podcasts, I chose to build an app that leverages English podcasts for learning. It took about six months to develop, and I released it on both iOS and Android.

<br>

This app allows English learners to study while listening to authentic English audio.

It includes **features like subtitles, translation, dictation, and reminders to support the learning process**.

<br>

However, **I shut down the app eight months after its release**.

The reason was the high maintenance costs.
I hadn’t properly considered the business model before launching, and the expenses, such as OpenAI API fees and backend server costs, were too high.
**Even with a growing user base, there was no potential for revenue**.

<br>

Although I closed the app, **I learned a lot about the importance of cost management from this project**. 

Since then, **I’ve made sure to carefully consider the business model before starting any personal development projects, making this experience incredibly valuable**.

<br>

I wrote a blog post about the shutdown.
