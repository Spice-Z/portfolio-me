This Podcast, "IT Trio", is hosted by three Japanese engineers.
I'm a main host, I'm doing all the editing and publishing work.

This Podcast has more than 800 subscribers and is growing steadily üëç

I created the website for the podcast, [IT Trio](https://it-trio-no.com), where you can listen to the episodes and read the show notes.
The site is open-source. You can check the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/it-trio/it-trio-web).
