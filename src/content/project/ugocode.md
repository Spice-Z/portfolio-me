## Story

I've always wanted to clearly convey code changes when giving talks or writing blog posts.
<br>
<br>
I‚Äôve thought that animations to show code differences are both beautiful and easy to understand, but creating them manually was a hassle, making it difficult to use them freely.  
<br>
<br>
One day, while preparing materials for an upcoming presentation, it hit me:

**"Why not create a website that makes it easy to generate these animations?"**

<br><br>
That's when I started working on UgoCode, and I managed to complete it in just two weeks!

## Features

The features of UgoCode is very simple:
<br><br>
1. **Paste your code**: Paste the code you want to compare.
2. **Click the button**: Click the button to generate the animation.
<br><br>

The all of animation is implemented with CSS and JavaScript, so there is no waiting time for the server to process the code.

Thanks to [Shiki](https://shiki.style/), great syntax highlighting library, UgoCode supports various languages and themes, so you can customize the appearance of your code diff animations. üëç
