## Story

I often use meme pictures as a way to communicate with people at work or in my personal life.

<br />

However, I found that it was troublesome to create a meme picture every time I wanted to use one.

It takes time to find a suitable image, edit it, and add text to it.

<br />

So I decided to create a meme generator site that would allow me to create meme pictures quickly and easily.

I achieved the ease of use by reducing the number of steps required to create a meme picture.

<br />

Now CoraPic has a many users. The average number of meme pictures created per month is over 10,000.


## Features

CoraPic is a meme generator site. You can create many meme pictures with no effort. All image processing is done in the browser, making CoraPic's image editing incredibly fast!

CoraPic has a bunch of meme templates.

All of the image processing is done in the browser by [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), making CoraPic's image editing incredibly fast!


I'm getting small revenue from ads on the site.
It's not much, but it's a good motivation for me to keep updating the site. ðŸ˜Š
