## Story

## Features

CoraPic is a meme generator site. You can create many meme pictures with no effort. All image processing is done in the browser, making CoraPic's image editing incredibly fast!

CoraPic has a bunch of meme templates.

By uploading your own image, or inputting text, you can create your own meme just in a few seconds.

All of the image processing is done in the browser by [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API), making CoraPic's image editing incredibly fast!


I'm getting small revenue from ads on the site.
It's not much, but it's a good motivation for me to keep updating the site. ðŸ˜Š
