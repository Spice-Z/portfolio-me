## Story

I already had a Chrome extension called LinkMemo, which was a simple 'Read Later' tool. 
It was a great tool for saving URLs and titles with just one click, but I wanted to make it more accessible and convenient for users.

<br />

So I decided to create a mobile app version of LinkMemo. The app allows users to save web page's content, read it later, and listen to it with text-to-speech.

<br />

By learning from other read-later apps and user feedback, I could created simple and easy-to-use app.


## Features

<br>

- **Save**: Download and save the page content. LinkMemo automatically extract the main content of the page, so there is no ads or unnecessary information.
- **Read**: Read the saved page later with cusomizable view. You can change font size, line height, and theme.
- **Listen**: Thanks to iOS's built-in text-to-speech, you can listen to the page content without internet connection with many voice models.

It's easy to save!

You can save the page content by sharing the page from Safari or other browser, or any other apps.
